## LANDING PAGE

Hi, this landing page use php laravel framework 8.83 and TailwindCSS 3.17. 
I use laravel to create PHP page because it's easy and give me good start to build the structure of the site. I love to using component views provided by Laravel.

Because this is only demo front static page. I didnt use database, but I create json_data to mimic the dynamics payload data that will be use in production. The json_data passed to resources/views/components/* component through class constructor in app/View/Components/* directory.
